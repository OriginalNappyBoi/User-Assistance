    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Trello is a helpful web based or application based tool that allows the users to
        organize teams,tasks, and objectives.</p>
        <p class="p">Trello is a web-based Kanban-style list making application. It was created by Fog Creek
            Software in 2011, and then later sold to Atlassian in January 2017, which is now based
            in New York City.</p>
        <div class="p">Users of Trello can create "Tasks board", with several columns and the users are allowed
            to move their tasks between the columns. Majortity of the time columns are ususally
            labeld, "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". This tool can be used for either personal or
            business use (see Figure 1). The application is free to use, however Trello does offer
            more options under their paid services; which will allow you do add more people and do
            more with their application.<figure class="fig fignone" id="introduction-to-trello__fig_lqv_xsr_xjb"><figcaption xmlns:table="http://dita-ot.sourceforge.net/ns/201007/dita-ot/table" xmlns:dita-ot="http://dita-ot.sourceforge.net/ns/201007/dita-ot" class="figcapcenter"><span class="figtitleprefix fig--title-label">Figure<span class="fig--title-label-number"> 1</span>: </span>Trello Example Board</figcaption>

        <p class="p">Typically Trello is used for, students organizing project teams, real estate management,
            software project management, lesson planning, and many more. With the addiiton of
            plentiful API including email-in capability, integration with enterprise systems, and
            cloud-based integration services, this makes project management easier to handle using
            this tool.</p>
