        <p class="p">Creating an account with Trello will allow you to store multiple bords while also
            allowing you to have access to their integrated API systems. Once you have created an
            account with Trello you can link it with various other applications that make cloud
            storage or project sharing easier for everyone on your team.</p>
        <p class="p">Creating a Team is an efficient way to gather people onto one board and have them
            structured in a way that they know what all the tasks that needs to be completed along
            with other tasks that need to be accomplished for the project. Teams are useful because
            you can add people based on their trello account which is linked to their emails for
            easy contact. Creating a team also allows you to make the team public or private. Teams
            can be used to add memebers to certain boards as needed, for example, if you are the
            project lead you can be apart of multiple boards, however if you are a person delegated
            to working on just UI, you will only have access to the board given to the UI team.</p>
