    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Kanban productivity method boosts quality and efficiency while improving the work
        process.  Trello is a well-suited tool for the Kanban method.</p>
        <p class="p">The Kanban method, famously used by Toyota in the 1960s, is a Japanese methodology that
            boosts quality and productivity while improving the work process. It has moved from car
            factories to a myriad of business types as a productivity solution, from retail to
            technology firms. Trello is a well-suited tool for the Kanban method.</p>
        <p class="p">In its simplest form, the Kanban method follows a workflow highlighted by three
            categories: "To Do," "Doing," and "Done." Using this methodology through Trello enables
            everyone to see the flow of work, reduces the chance of too much work being in process,
            keeps the team consistent, and promotes trust.</p>
        <div class="p">The Kanban method can be represented by many different development processes, but an
            example might be "To Do," "Development," "Code Review," "Testing," and "Done." <figure class="fig fignone" id="concept_kyq_rvt_tjb__fig_d2l_syt_tjb"><figcaption xmlns:table="http://dita-ot.sourceforge.net/ns/201007/dita-ot/table" xmlns:dita-ot="http://dita-ot.sourceforge.net/ns/201007/dita-ot" class="figcap"><span class="figtitleprefix fig--title-label">Figure<span class="fig--title-label-number"> 1</span>: </span>Kanban Workflow Example</figcaption>

            </figure>Each list corresponds to a process point, and each card represents a task in the
            workflow. As the task is completed, it will move from left to right through the board.
            Labels can be used to assign each task with a priority level.</div>
        <p class="p">The Kanban methodology applies well with Trello because of its ability to create positive
            change without reorganizing your current workflow. Experiment with the Kanban method on
            your Trello to see how your efficiency and quality of work improves!</p>
