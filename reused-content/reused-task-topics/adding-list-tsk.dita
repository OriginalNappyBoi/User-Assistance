        <steps>
            <step>
                <cmd>In the middle of the screen you have an option to add lists to your already
                    created board. If you wish to add lists to your board, click the "add list"
                    option on the screen. Adding a list can help keep track of smaller tasks that
                    can help lead to completeing a bigger task. see (Figure 1). </cmd>

                <cmd>After clicking this option you will need to enter a title for the list you want
                    to add. Once you have added the tittle click add (Figure 2). Naming the list
                    with a consistent naming heiracrchy will make it easier to track which sub-tasks
                    have been completed.</cmd>

                    created is very simple, just click the three dots on the top right and you can
                    add items, check items off, or even cross items off the list as you see
